So you want to collect your Docker logs and send them anywhere? Sounds simple! Sadly, it is not.
When you account for x, y, and z, you quickly realize this is no easy endaevor.
Especially for high volume product environments! Fear not! This guide will get
you up and running in minutes.

## What We'll Accomplish In This Guide

<ol className="list--checks list--lg list--semi-bold list--primary list--flush">
  <li>Collect Docker container logs.</li>
  <li>Filter which containers you collect them from.</li>
  <li>Automatically merge logs that Docker splits.</li>
  <li>Enrich your logs with useful Docker context.</li>
  <li>Send your logs to one or more destinations</li>
  <li className="list--li--arrow list--li--pink">All in just a few minutes. Let's get started!</li>

## Deployment Strategy

For this guide we'll be using Vector, which is a lightweight and ultra-fast
utility for building observability pipelines. We'll deploy Vector as a dedicated
Logging container. This has a number of advantages:

1. **Same workflow** - Vector is deploy as a container like your other services.
1. **Dependency free** - You do not need to install anything on the host.
1. **Easy to scale** - Simply deploy more logging containers as necessary.
1. **Fast & reliable** - Built in [Rust][urls.rust], Vector is [blistering fast and memory efficient][urls.vector_performance].
1. **Flexible** - Vector includes a robust set of [transforms][docs.transforms] to process your data.


## A Simple Step-By-Step Tutorial

    the next step.
   * The [`docker` source][docs.sources.docker] tells Vector to collect Docker
    logs.
   * The the [`console` sink][docs.sinks.console] simply prints the collected
    logs so that we can manually verify everything is working.

2. ### Start Vector as a container

   ```bash
   docker run \
   -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
   -v $PWD/vector.toml:/etc/vector/vector.toml:ro \
   timberio/vector:latest-alpine
   ```

   <CodeExplanation>

   * The first `-v` flag ensures that Vector has access to the Docker socket.
     This is how Vector receives Docker logs.
   * The second `-v` flag passes the previously created Vector configuration
     file into the container.

   </CodeExplanation>

   That's it! Simple and to the point. Hit `ctrl+c` to exit.
