As shown in the diagram above, the [service deployment strategy][docs.strategies.service]
treats Vector like any other service. Vector must be configured with [a source
that receives data over the network][urls.vector_receiving_sources], and the
upstream service must use that protocol to send data to Vector. This could be
another Vector instance using the [`vector` sink][docs.sinks.vector] or any
service that can send log data over the configured protocol.
